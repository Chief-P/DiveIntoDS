### Queue

Insert/Delete restricted list.

Discussed Circular Queue.

According to Pigeon Hole Principle, *r-f* can represent *n-1* states, so the actual size of circular queue shrinks to *n-1* in order to avoid ambuiguity(f: front, r: off-the-end).

Yet another solution is to add a new variable to record the last operation.
